# SEAtizen Science Shiny App
Visualizing whale presence over time in the Santa Barbara Channel 

Project Designers: Jasmine Vazin and Molly Williams... and sean goral

Our app will depict whale sightings recorded by the Channel Islands Naturalist Corps volunteers using the Whale Alert and Spotter Pro apps from 2012-present. Data will be accessed from the SQL database we created as a deliverable for our group project, SEAtizen Science. The app will visualize spatial data that can be filtered through queries to this database. Users can interact with the data by selecting for species and year, with the option to add model layers representing threats and habitat suitability created in Maxent.
