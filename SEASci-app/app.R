The volunteers are part of the Channel Islands Naturalist Corps, a program started by Channel Island National Marine Sanctuary (CINMS) in the 1990s. The Naturalist Corps is comprised of over 160 volunteers who record data on marine life nearly every day aboard whale watching boats in the Santa Barbara Channel (SBC). When the program first started, sightings were recorded on paper logs. Since 2013, volunteers input data directly into the Spotter Pro mobile application while aboard marine vessels, typically the Condor Express whale watching boat out of Santa Barbara, CA. Only trained Naturalists can access the Spotter Pro app, but another CINMS mobile application called Whale Alert allows the general public to record sightings. This citizen-collected information has been used to create on of the largest datasets on marine mammals in the SBC, and was even used by CINMS to move shipping lanes in 2013 by one nautical mile to prevent whale ship strikes.
